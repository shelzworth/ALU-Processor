# ALU-Processor

This was the final lab and project for COE 328 Digital Systems. Using Quartus II and logic gates, we students built up different parts of the ALU which ultimately resulted in this cumulative project which tasked us with the objective of 
combining all the elements to create a functional ALU. Once the ALU was developed we could generate block diagrams and test out various problem sets which were given as function, microcode and expected result. We were then tested on
replicating these results within the demo period by uploading the code from Quartus to the FPGA board.

The final report of this project is listed under COE 328 Lab 6 Final Report.pdf. 
Please only use this project only as reference, some files may be missing as a result of file transfer between systems and
much of the files may not work correctly after being downloaded from the internet. You may also be liable to school senate policies.
